# # My Data Science Notebook
# 

# ## Introduction
# 
# Welcome to my Data Science Notebook! In this notebook, I will explore various data science topics and techniques. We will delve into data analysis, visualization, and even some machine learning. So, let's get started on this exciting journey of data science!
# 

# ## Data Science Languages
# 
# In the field of data science, various programming languages are commonly used, including:
# 
# - Python
# - R
# - Julia
# - SQL
# - Scala
# 

# ## Data Science Libraries
# 
# In data science, a variety of libraries are available to assist in tasks like data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. Some commonly used data science libraries include:
# 
# - NumPy
# - Pandas
# - Matplotlib

# ## Arithmetic Expression Examples
# 
# In this section, we'll explore some basic arithmetic expressions using Python. We'll cover addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These examples will help you understand how to perform common arithmetic operations in Python.
# 

# In[4]:


# Multiply and add numbers
number1 = 5
number2 = 10

# Multiplication
result_multiply = number1 * number2

# Addition
result_add = number1 + number2

result_multiply, result_add


# In[5]:


# Convert minutes to hours
minutes = 120

# Conversion
hours = minutes / 60

hours


# ## Objectives
# 
# - Explore fundamental data science concepts
# - Practice data analysis and visualization
# - Learn how to use Jupyter Notebook effectively
# - Perform basic arithmetic calculations in Python
# - Convert units of time (minutes to hours) using Python
